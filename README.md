📌 Overview
This project leverages Deep Learning models to detect cataracts from eye images. It is implemented in Google Colab using TensorFlow and Keras. The model processes eye images and predicts the likelihood of cataract presence, helping in early diagnosis and medical intervention.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow & Keras (Deep Learning Framework)

OpenCV & PIL (Image Processing)

Google Colab (Cloud-Based Training)

NumPy & Pandas (Data Handling)

🎯 Features
✅ Pretrained Model Support – Uses transfer learning for accuracy
✅ Image Preprocessing – Enhances image clarity before prediction
✅ Real-time Predictions – Upload an image and get results instantly
✅ Model Training & Evaluation – Custom dataset support for retraining
✅ Google Colab Integration – Easy to run and modify online
